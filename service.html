12. Dispute Resolution

<br>

THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THEY AFFECT EACH PARTY’S RIGHTS CONCERNING THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE (DEFINED BELOW) BETWEEN THE PARTIES. This Dispute Resolution section applies to general disputes between you and Afterpay. Any dispute with regards to an Afterpay transaction is governed by the specific governing Afterpay transaction document. To the extent of any conflict in dispute resolution terms, the subsequent in time transaction document will control.  

 
<br>
12.1 To expedite resolution and the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim between you and us related to any dispute or controversy arising from or relating to your use or inability to use the Services and generally with respect to Afterpay, this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement (a “Dispute”), you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon receipt of a written notice (each, a “Notice”). Your address for such Notices is your most recent address provided to us in connection with your Account, or an email to the email address you have provided in your Afterpay Account. Our address for such notices is: Afterpay US, Inc, PO Box 328, San Francisco, CA 94104-0328, Attention: Legal, or by email to uslegal@afterpay.com. Any Notice from you must include your name, pertinent Account information, a brief description of the Dispute, and your contact information, so that we may evaluate the Dispute and attempt to informally resolve the Dispute. Any Notice from us will include pertinent Account information, a brief description of the Dispute, and our contact information, so that you may evaluate the Dispute and attempt to informally resolve the Dispute. If the informal negotiations are successful, no further action is necessary.
<br>
 

12.2 IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE THROUGH INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EITHER YOU OR WE MAY ELECT TO HAVE THE DISPUTE (EXCEPT THOSE DISPUTES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED BELOW) FINALLY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ANY ELECTION TO ARBITRATE BY ONE PARTY WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON THE OTHER. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and we may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

 <br>

12.3 The parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any suit to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; (2) any suit to seek temporary injunctive relief that will remain in place only until an arbitrator can determine whether the relief should be continued, modified or removed; or (3) any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, either party may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New Castle County, Delaware or any United States county where you live or work.

 <br>

12.4 The parties agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (1) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (2) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS-ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (3) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

 <br>

12.5 Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California. The parties agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction and the parties agree to submit to the venue the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
<br>
 

12.6 You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration clause and class action/jury trial waiver provision of this Agreement by NOTIFYING US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU LAST PLACED AN ORDER. To opt out, you must send a written notification to us at uslegal@afterpay.com, Attention: Legal, that includes (i) your Afterpay Account identification, (ii) your name, (iii) your address, (iv) your telephone number, (v) your email address and (vi) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver sections.
<br>
 

13. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction

<br>

Except as expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the agreement to arbitrate in Section 12 must be brought in state or federal court in or closest to, San Francisco County, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there and both parties agree to waive their right to a jury trial.

 
<br>
14. Limitation of Liability


<br>
To the extent not prohibited by law, under no circumstances shall we, our subsidiaries, partners, or affiliates, be liable to you for: (a) personal injury or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary damages, arising from or relating to this Agreement, the use of or inability to use an Afterpay Account, the Services, or our or your liabilities to third parties arising from any source; or (b) except as required under applicable law, any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary damages, arising from or relating to the conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the use of an Afterpay Account or the Services, including, but not limited to, damages arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or a third party’s failure to correctly verify such information. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. You agree that if any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this Agreement, the aggregate liability of us and our affiliates and suppliers to you for all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use or inability to use the Services will not (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the greater of: (a) the amount you any affected order(s) giving rise to such damages, or (b) the amount of five hundred U.S. dollars ($500.00). These limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

 
<br>
15. Indemnification

<br>

You agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to: (a) your access to, use of, or inability to use your Afterpay Account or the Services; (b) your breach or alleged breach of this Agreement; (c) your violation of any rights of a third party, including but not limited to any negligent or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents, or a breach of any contracts or other relationships between you and third parties; (d) your violation of any applicable law; or (e) your failure to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information in your Afterpay Account. You shall cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any such claim. Afterpay reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Afterpay. For the avoidance of doubt, this indemnification, defense and hold harmless obligation will survive these Terms of Use and the termination of your use of the Services.

 <br>
